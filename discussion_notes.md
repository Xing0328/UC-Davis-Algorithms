Topological Sort
----
### Def:
#### The topological sort of a dag `G = (V, E)` is a linear ordering of all its vertices such that if G contains an edge `(u,v)`, then `u` appears before `v` in the ordering. (If the graph contains a cycle, then no linear ordering is possible.)

```
1. call DFS(G) to compute finishing times v[f] for each vertex v in G
2. as each vertex is finished, insert it onto the front of a linked list
3. return the linked list of vertices
```

* hand-wave correctness during example
* consider what happens when cycle

Minimal Spanning Tree
---
### Def: Spanning Tree
Given a connected, undirected graph ->

a tree that connects all the vertices together. A single graph can have many different spanning trees.

### Def: Minimal Spanning Tree
We can also assign a weight to each edge, which is a number representing how unfavorable it is, and use this to assign a weight to a spanning tree by computing the sum of the weights of the edges in that spanning tree. A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree is then a spanning tree with weight less than or equal to the weight of every other spanning tree. More generally, any undirected graph (not necessarily connected) has a minimum spanning forest, which is a union of minimum spanning trees for its connected components.

# How to produce MST?

## Kruskal's Algorithm

At a high level: take all the edges, sort them on weight.  Iterate through the edges and add the edge into the graph iff it does not create a cycle.

    MST-Kruskal(G, w)
    Assuming G = (V, E)

    1.  A = Ã˜
    2.  for each vertex v in V
    3.      MAKE-SET(v)
    4.  sort the edges of E into nondecreasing order by weight w
    5.  for each edge(u,v) in E
    6.      if FIND-SET(u) != FIND-SET(v)
    7.          A.append(u,v)
    8.          UNION(u,v)
    9.  return A

Strongly Connected Components
---

```
1.  call DFS(G) to compute finishing times u[f] for each vertex u
2.  compute Gt = Transpose(G)
3.  call DFS(Gt), but in the main loop of DFS, consider vertices in order of decreasing u[f]
    (as computed in line 1)
4.  output the vertices of each tree in the depth-first forest formed in line 3 as a separate
    strongly connected component
```
